# Bank-Account-Management-System

Synopsis

Bank Accounts Management System which starts with a manual data entry by admin to editing accounts. Customers get access to their account to withdraw or deposit money, as well as change their pin and renew account. Admin can access all accounts and edit all data. Credit-card number and pin number are auto-generated and duplicate credit-card numbers cannot be made. All contents are stored in a csv file. Cyber security for such systems is of huge importance, thus, pin numbers are encrypted. Hence, anyone viewing the file cannot access customers’ pin.


The program is subdivided into 2 domains:


1.	Admin interface:
 	Add accounts
 	Edit accounts
 	Search accounts
 	Delete/renew accounts which has expired
 	Delete accounts
 	Sort accounts
 	Project all accounts
 	Display/change pin
 	Renew accounts
  
2.	Customer interface:
 	Deposit/withdraw money
 	Check balance
 	Renew account
 	View account details
 	Change pin



The new system is built with the following objectives: -
•	Information retrieval will become easy.
•	Security of data stored is optimised.
•	Maintenance of data as will become easy.
•	Modification of the data will become easy.
